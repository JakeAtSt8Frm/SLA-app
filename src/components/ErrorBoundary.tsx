/**
 * Render-error containment.
 *
 * Everything downstream of `loadLeague` is derived data — value indexes, fitted
 * distributions, matchup matrices — and a single unexpected shape from Sleeper
 * can surface as a throw deep inside a page rather than as a failed fetch. Without
 * a boundary React unmounts the whole tree on the way out, so one bad chart takes
 * the navigation with it and the only recovery is a manual reload.
 *
 * Two are mounted. The inner one wraps the routed page, so the header and tabs
 * survive and the reader can simply walk to another page; it resets on
 * navigation, since the next route is a different render entirely. The outer one
 * wraps the app itself and only catches what the inner one cannot — a failure in
 * the shell or the provider.
 *
 * The cache is the other likely culprit: a persisted payload written by an older
 * build can deserialize into a shape this build doesn't expect, and it would be
 * re-read on every reload. So "clear cached data" is offered alongside the retry
 * rather than left for the reader to find in the settings menu.

/*
 * Stale-deployment recovery.
 *
 * Routes are code-split, so the loaded entry chunk holds the *filenames* of the
 * page chunks that existed when the tab was opened. Those names are content
 * hashed and the Pages workflow redeploys on a daily cron, so a tab left open
 * overnight is holding names the server no longer has: the next tab tapped in
 * the morning fails to import, not because anything is wrong but because the app
 * moved underneath it.
 *
 * A reload fixes it completely — it refetches index.html and with it the current
 * chunk names. Doing that automatically is right here because there is nothing
 * for the reader to decide and no work to lose; this is a static, read-only app.
 * The timestamp guard is what keeps a genuinely broken deploy from reloading in
 * a loop: after one attempt the error card is shown instead.
