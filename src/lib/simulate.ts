/**
 * Monte Carlo over the forecast distributions in `forecast.ts`.
 *
 * Two questions, one engine:
 *
 *  - **Win probability**, for a week in progress. Players who have finished
 *    contribute their real score; everyone still to play is sampled. This is the
 *    number that actually changes how a Sunday feels, and it is only honest if
 *    the correlation structure is right — see the note on shared shocks below.
 *
 *  - **Playoff, seed and title odds**, from any week forward. The remaining
 *    schedule is replayed thousands of times and the bracket is resolved under
 *    the league's own playoff settings.
 *
 * ## Why the sampling is not independent
 *
 * The temptation is to draw each player independently. That is wrong in a way
 * that matters: two players in the same NFL game share a pace, a game script and
 * a weather report, so their outcomes move together. Independent draws make a
 * team total's variance far too small — sums of independent variables
 * concentrate — and a simulator with too little variance reports win
 * probabilities pushed toward 0% and 100%. It looks decisive and is wrong.
 *
 * So each NFL team gets one shared shock per iteration, and every player on it
 * mixes that shock with an idiosyncratic one in proportion to the correlation
 * measured for his position group. The mixing happens in Gaussian space and is
 * pushed back through each group's own empirical quantile function, which is a
 * Gaussian copula: the dependence is induced without disturbing any of the
 * skewed, heteroskedastic marginals that were fit from real data.
 *
 * This also correctly couples *opposing fantasy teams*. Two managers in the same
 * league frequently own players in the same NFL game, and the shared shock is
 * drawn once per NFL team per iteration across the whole league — so those
 * holdings move together, exactly as they do in reality.
