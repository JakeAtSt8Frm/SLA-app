 * (#teams, #history), so existing bookmarks keep working.

 * The outer boundary is the last resort. AppShell has its own around the routed
 * page, which catches almost everything and keeps the navigation usable; this
 * one exists for the rest — a throw in the shell itself or in the provider —
 * where the alternative is a blank document with no way back.
